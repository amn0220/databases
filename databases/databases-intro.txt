>Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A database is used to store and update any type of data. Data needs to persist beyond closing a program, so this is where databases are necessary. Text files seem to be useful when one person is working on the file at once so changes won’t get locked out or overwritten.

>Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

SQL is a declarative language, meaning the database is told what it needs to look for instead of how to look for it, unlike procedural languages.

>In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

The database system is structured like a table of data (defined in columns with corresponding values) and has the power to search and change(update/add to) the data.

>Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

Databases display data in a table structure of rows and columns. The columns run vertically and define the data, the rows run horizontally and contain cells (where columns and rows intersect) of values. Values are pieces of information defined by the columns.

>List three data types that can be used in a table.

	-string
	-integer
	-float

>Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:

     SELECT date, amount
     FROM payments;

     SELECT amount
     FROM payments
     WHERE amount > 500;

     SELECT *
     FROM payments
     WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';

-First, I’m looking for the date and amount columns from the payments table.

-Second, I’m looking for the amount column from the payments table where the amount is greater than 500.

-Third, I’m looking for all columns in the payments table where the payee is Mega Foods.
